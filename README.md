1. Write a program that can encrypt  and decrypt using the Additive Cipher.
2. Write a program that can encrypt and decrypyt using the Affine Cipher 
3. Write a program that can perform a letter frequency attack on an additive cipher without human intervention. Your software should produce possible plain text in rough order of           likelihood. It would be good if your user interface allows user to specify " Give me top 10 possible plain texts"
4. Write a program that can perform a letter frequency attack on any monoalphabetic substitution cipher without human intervention. Your software should produce possible plain text in       rough order of likelihood. It would be good if your user interface allows user to specify " Give me top 10 possible plain texts"
5. Write a program that can encrypt and Decrypt using a 2 X 2 Hill Cipher.
